However, since they are used in ControlTemplates,</p>\r\n<p>I'm guessing all colors have to be loaded before the latter are constructed to take full effect. Is there any way to do this without much modification of the theme itself -</p>\r\n<p>preferrably something equivalent to&nbsp; &lt;Color x:Key=&quot;myColor&quot; Binding=&quot;{ /* Binding to Properties-&gt;colorXY */ }&quot;/&gt; ?</p>\r\n<p>BTW, I tried using DynamicResources instead of static ones in the ControlTemplates, didn't seem to help</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Ferdinand</p>\r\n",
