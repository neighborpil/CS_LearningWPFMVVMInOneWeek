I'd prefer not touching the WPF.Themes project, so that I can update it on new releases.</p>\r\n<p>But I haven't figured out how to match my custom control styles to the WPF.Themes. For the moment, I just comment all but the style I need. Obviously, I'd prefer to have my custom styles automatically kick in when the matching WPFTheme is applied (using ApplyTheme). Is there a way to do that? Or I absolutely need to define my custom styles directly in WPF.Themes/Expression*/Theme.xaml?</p>\r\n<p><br>Anthony</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
