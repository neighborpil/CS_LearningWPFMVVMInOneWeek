    "Html": "If I add a couple of radio buttons and set the IsChecked property on one of the them to True.  When the window displays, the radio button does not display checked state.  It is not until I check the other radio button that they will start to display correctly.  Whats worse is if I change the theme the checked radio button will no longer look checked unless I select the other radio button again.  The demo app from the source code download does this as well.  Is there a bug in the templates?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am using the March 23rd source code and the March 21st release of the WPF toolkit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso with these I cannot display several of the themes, I get a XAML error - 'The attachable property 'VisualStateGroups' was not found in type 'VisualStateManager'.\r\n",
