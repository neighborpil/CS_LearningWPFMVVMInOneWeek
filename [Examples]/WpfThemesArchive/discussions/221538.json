This shouldn't really make a difference, and the error &quot;XamlParseException&quot; would indicate its an issue in the raw xaml anyway. Have you made changes to the xaml? What is the body of the ApplyTheme method. I use the following code, where filename is the path to the theme file to load e.g &quot;C:\\ExpressionDark.xaml&quot;</p>\r\n<p>//Initialize Resource Directory.<br>ResourceDictionary skin = new ResourceDictionary();</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;//Set new source.<br>skin.Source = new Uri(filename, UriKind.Absolute);<br><br>&nbsp;//Merge.<br>App.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add(skin);</p>",
