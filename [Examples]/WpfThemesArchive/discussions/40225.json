    "Html": "Hi Rudi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for the update! However, even with the latest version I get some unwanted scrollbars. I made some screenshots for you with XamlPadX that I hope can be useful:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar1.png<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar2.png<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar3.png<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar4.png<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar5.png<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar6.png<br>\r\nhttp://silverfox.zoopsia.org/wpf/scrollbar7.png<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The URL manager freaked out on me when adding the links)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe XAML is probably a little clumsy as I just copied some of it from a project, but it shows that with every theme, there is a scrollbar on the right - empty, but present. If the &quot;Auto&quot; setting worked, I don't see why it should show up - but even when I explicitly disable it (as in the screenshots), it remains. If I remove the reference to Theme.xaml, then the &quot;default&quot; WPF theme doesn't show a scrollbar, btw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry to pester you about this, but I know a lot of people will be using these great themes, so QA is in everyone's best interest. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
