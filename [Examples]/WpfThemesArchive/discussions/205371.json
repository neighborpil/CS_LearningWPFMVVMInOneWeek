While this works, I see no reason why it is necessary to limit the flexibility of the style this way. I suggest changing the TabPanel element in the template to ItemsPresenter. This worked fine for me locally (haven't noticed any problems). I wanted a TabControl that stacked its items using a StackPanel (kind of like the navigation control in Outlook), so I needed to be able to change the ItemsPanel (without restyling the whole thing).</p>",
