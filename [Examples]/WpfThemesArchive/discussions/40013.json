Use the Application extension method (Read more <a href=\"http://dotnet.org.za/rudi/archive/2008/11/07/wpf-themes-update.aspx\">here</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are current, currently Password, TextBlock, DatePicker, Calendar, etc is not supported yet! I tried to get all the &quot;normal&quot; wpf controls in first! Have a look at the home page, their is a list of supported and planned control support! I just added the Expander control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep up the great feedback!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRudi\r\n",
