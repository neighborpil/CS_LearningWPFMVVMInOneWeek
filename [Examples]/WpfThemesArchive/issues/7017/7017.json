    "Description": "There is a bug in the WPF Framework that having the TreeViewItem have a MultiTrigger tied to it with a SourceName element exposes.  This is a very odd bug because it will only occur in the case where the TreeViewItem is selected before being created.  A way of creating this is to bind a TreeView to an collection.  The collection needs to refresh so that the selected item is removed and a new item is added as the first item.  This will cause a null pointer exception see http://www.steelyeyedview.com/2010/02/sourcename-in-multitriggers-in-wpf.html for an explination of where the WPF bug is.  To work around this in the styles the SourceName needs to be removed.  This occurs in SourceName=\"Selection_Border\" in the BureauBlack, BureauBlue, ExpressionDark, ExpressionLight, ShinyBlue, ShinyDarkGreen, ShinyRed.\nÂ \nRemoving the SourceName=\"Selection_Border\" from the trigger has minimum effect because the border that is the immediate child of the control and fills the control.  Therefore there is no noticeable difference in the change",
