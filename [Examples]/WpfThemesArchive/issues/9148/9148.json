    "Description": "I have a ComboBox bound to the installed fonts, and use a custom item template to render each item in the corresponding font. If there are a lot of fonts installed, this menu takes a seriously long time to load without virtualization. With virtualization it is very manageable. Unfortunately, since I installed Expression Dark, virtualization seems to have been broken and the menu takes ages, even though it worked fine before.",
