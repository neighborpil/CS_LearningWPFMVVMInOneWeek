    "Description": "By using the Bureau* and Expression* thems I have problem with ListBox with SelectionMode=\"Multiple\". I am limiting the number of selected items to constant value by calling SelectedItems.RemoveAt method in code behind. These changes made programmatically were not reflected in UI - all items were selected.\nÂ \nI managed to resolve this issue by replacing ListBoxItem's ControlTemplate's\n<Trigger Property=\"IsSelected\" Value=\"true\"> <Trigger.ExitActions> and <Trigger.EnterActions>\nby two equivalent Trigger setters.",
