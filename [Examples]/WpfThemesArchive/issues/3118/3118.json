      "Message": "Playing around with the solution in blend, I can confirm that the issue it not with the actual xaml of the progressbar. If you link the progressbar to any of the resource dictionaries things are fine ... so somehow the way the theme is loaded is stopping the progressbar (and others?) to not receive its proper template.",
